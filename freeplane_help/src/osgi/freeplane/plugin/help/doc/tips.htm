<h3><font color="#669900" face="Arial">Graphical links</font></h3>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">You can create graphical links between two nodes, like 
  this:</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="tips.h1.gif" width="551" height="113"><br>
To do so, mark a node and drag to another node holding both shift and control 
keys, and releasing the mouse button first.</li> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">You can edit some properties of this link by 
  right-clicking on the line between them. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">You may choose the color and the arrow positions.
  </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Go directly to one of the nodes (even if it's folded) 
  by using the link in the right-click menu. </font></li>
</ul>
<h4><font color="#669900" face="Arial">File locking</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">The current version of Freeplane has experimental file 
locking, which is disabled by default. The current implementation (0.7.1) does 
not really prevent race conditions, but it should be fine for the most practical 
purposes. What does file locking mean? It makes sure that multiple users do not 
edit the same map at the same time, preventing them from accidentally 
overwriting each other's information. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can enable experimental file locking if you are a 
technical user and are willing to edit user.properties, as described in
<a href="customize.htm">Customizing Freeplane</a>. </font></p>
<h4><font color="#669900" face="Arial">Browsing mind maps</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">You can browse the mindmaps in browse mode. Why is there a 
separate mode for browsing? That's because browsing is the only thing you can do 
in the Freeplane applet, which can be put to your website. Normally, you would 
not use browse mode in Freeplane. </font></p>
<h4><font color="#669900" face="Arial">Browsing the files on your computer
</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">You can browse the files on your computer using file mode. 
To enter file mode, in menu: Modes &gt; File. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can then browse the file tree as if it was a mindmap. 
You can make any folder the root of the map by chosing &quot;Center&quot; from the node 
menu. To view or execute a file, follow the link of the node. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The file mode is currently not very useful; it is a 
demonstration that it's not too difficult to feed data into the tree from other 
source than the mindmap. There is no evidence that people would really use this 
mode. </li>
</font></p>
<h4><font color="#669900" face="Arial">There is a concept of mode in Freeplane
</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">Although Freeplane is primarily a tool for editing mindmaps, 
it is designed to be able to view data coming from different data sources. &nbsp;To 
make a specific data source available for viewing in Freeplane, a programmer has 
to write a so-called mode for that data source. In the standard, there is an 
example of such a mode, namely file mode. We do not know of any other modes 
implemented. It is not clear if anyone would really want to make use of this 
architecture, but it's here to be exploited if someone wants to. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Furthermore, there is code almost ready for Scheme Mode 
which enables you to edit scheme programs. Again, the usefulness is far from 
clear. While the mindmap mode is clearly a real thing, other modes seem to be 
more a demonstration of what is possible than something really used by people.
