<h2><font color="#669900" face="Arial">Printing </font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">You can print either by fitting the whole map into one 
page, or by printing the map to several sheets of paper. You can set this choice 
in the File menu, under Page Setup. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Choosing the landscape option usually looks better and 
makes better use of space.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If you want to preview your map before you print it and 
have a PostScript printer or generic PostScript driver, you can print the map 
into a file and view the PostScript file view with Ghostview or similar 
software. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Beware that if you try to print to a file with a printer 
that does not understand PostScript, the resulting file will not be PostsSript 
but probably PCL, which is unusable for you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can also print from your browser after exporting a map 
to HTML, or from Word or Wordpad after copying and pasting the map into it. You 
can also export the map into HTML with headings, copy and paste it into MS Word 
and print it from there. That way you can change styles as you want. </font></p>
