<h2><font color="#669900" face="Arial">Pictures and HTML in nodes </font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">An easy way to insert pictures into Freeplane is by using 
Node / Set Image in the right-click popup menu (or Alt+K). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">However, pictures in Freeplane are a preliminary feature:
</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">You lose all the text you had in the node. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Pictures may overlap the text of nodes above them.
  </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Images are not correctly pasted outside Freeplane and 
  they may not be correctly exported to HTML. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial">If a node contains a link to an image, you can replace the 
contents of the node with the image by using the Set Image function. You can 
drag and drop several image files into Freeplane, select them as multiple nodes, 
and them turn them into images in one step by choosing Set Image. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial">A more technical and not-so-user-friendly 
way to put pictures in the nodes is by including the HTML. You have to start the 
node content with the tag &lt;html&gt;. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">E.g.: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">&lt;html&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;linked/Apple.png&quot;&gt; </font></li>
