<p><font face="Arial">Freeplane is a premier, free mind-mapping program written
in Java.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Freeplane will let you organize your ideas as a &quot;mindmap,&quot;
a graphical structure of nodes and branches (or edges) attached to a central
&quot;root&quot; node.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For a quick look at a fully developed mindmap, click
<a href="samplepage.htm">here</a><a href="http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/Freeplane-computer-knowledge.png">.</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Want to write a completely new metaphysics? Why don't you
use Freeplane? You have a tool at hand that remarkably resembles the tray slips
Robert Pirsig described in &quot;Lila,&quot; his sequel to &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance.&quot; Do you want to refactor your essays as you would refactor
software? Or do you want to keep an easily managed personal knowledge base? Why
don't you try Freeplane?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can easily create, move and format nodes and edges.
Features include:</font></p>
<li><font face="Arial">Easy control of <b>folding, </b>or the ability to display
or hide all information below a selected node. This is the essential property of
Freeplane. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial"><b>Fast one-click navigation</b>, including folding /
unfolding with one click and following links with one click at the same time
(you don't have to make choice between fast following of links and fast
fold/unfold). You can move the map by dragging the map's background as well as
using mouse wheel. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">Fully functional <b>following of HTML links</b> stored in
the nodes, be they WWW links or links to local files. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial"><b>Smart Drag and Drop</b>, including the ability to copy
nodes or copy the style of nodes; dragging and dropping of multiple selected
nodes; dropping of text or lists of files from outside.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial"><b>Smart copying and pasting into</b>, including pasting
of links from HTML or structuring the pasted content on the basis of the number
of leading spaces in a line; pasting of lists of selected files.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial"><b>Smart copying and pasting from</b>, including plain
text and RTF (MS Wordpad, MS Word, MS Outlook messages). </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial"><b>Export of your map to HTML</b>, with folding. </font>
</li>
<li><font face="Arial"><b>Find</b> facility, where found items are shown one by
one as you do &quot;find next&quot;, and the map is unfolded only for the current item.
</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial"><b>Short nodes, </b>or <b>long multiline nodes</b> with
line breaks. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">The option to decorate nodes with <b>built-in icons</b>,
colors and different fonts. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial"><b>Low cost of switching away</b> to another mind-mapping
tool, because Freeplane stores maps in <b>XML</b> format. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial">File mode enables you to <b>browse the files on your
computer</b>, <b>seeing</b> the folder structure <b>as a mindmap</b>.</font></li>
