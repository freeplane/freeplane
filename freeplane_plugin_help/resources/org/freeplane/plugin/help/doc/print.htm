<h2><font color="#669900" face="Arial">Printing </font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">You can print either by fitting the whole map into one
page, or by printing the map to several sheets of paper. You can set this choice
in the File menu, under Page Setup. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Choosing the landscape option usually looks better and
makes better use of space.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If you want to preview your map before you print it and
have a PostScript printer or generic PostScript driver, you can print the map
into a file and view the PostScript file view with Ghostview or similar
software. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Beware that if you try to print to a file with a printer
that does not understand PostScript, the resulting file will not be PostsSript
but probably PCL, which is unusable for you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can also print from your browser after exporting a map
to HTML, or from Word or Wordpad after copying and pasting the map into it. You
can also export the map into HTML with headings, copy and paste it into MS Word
and print it from there. That way you can change styles as you want. </font></p>
